# Project3_Happiness
Data analysis of determinants of happiness per country in 2023:

Initial data retrieved from 3 sources with a focus on 2023: Crime.csv (Crime Rate by Country 2023 retrieved from https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/crime-rate-by-country), Happiness.csv (World Happiness Report 2023 retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2023), and Freedom.csv (2023 Heritage Foundation Economic Freedom data retrieved from https://www.heritage.org/index/explore?view=by-region-country-year&countryids=&regionids=&yearids=24).

.csv files were imported into SQL where the data was housed and merged to produce one database and a corresponding.csv file with 111 unique records: Happiness_Factors.sql and Happiness_Factors.csv
